# NSW Meeting Cost Calculator

Available at [tjharrop.github.io/meetingcostcalculator](http://tjharrop.github.io/meetingcostcalculator), based on [meetingcostcalculator.ca](http://meetingcostcalculator.ca/)

Ever wondered how much your team meetings cost? The Meeting Cost Calculator lets you calculate an estimated cost for meetings, using the standard pay rates used by a variety of public sector organisations.

- Data for the core public service is adapted from the [Public Service Commission website](https://www.psc.nsw.gov.au/reports---data/state-of-the-sector/previous-editions/state-of-the-sector-2015/nsw-public-sector-at-a-glance).
- Meeting costs are determined by converting annual salaries into hourly rates, then multiplying these against the elapsed time. Salary classifications with a range of levels are simplified to minimum, maximum, and median rates, which can be selected under the gear options menu.
